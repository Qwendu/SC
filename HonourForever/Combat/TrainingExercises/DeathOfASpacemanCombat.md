# Death of a Spaceman

... permadeath.

Is not goood, obviously.

## Setting up the training exercise

- 4+ people are needed at least
- Fight around GrimHex
- 2 in a cuttlas red
- 2+ in fighers

Fighters fight each other and have to gauge how many shots they can take and if they can realistically take down the target before they die.

FAILSTATE: Death of one Pilot!

FIGHTERS always try to eject before death and then they need to get picked up by the cutlass red and brought back to the space station.

WIN CONDITION: One Fighter gets destroyed, but the pilot gets rescued and brought back to station.
