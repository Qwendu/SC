# Aaron Halo Belt Tracking

## Introductory words
This task is quite a complicated research goal which will be seriously hard to achieve and will take much effort to turn out successfull.

### Setup
As experienced Miners know there is a Asteroid Belt in the Stanton system.
It is one of the few areas with a high asteroid density.
In the few Mining-OPS of Honour (as of 3.13 2021-3-2) it has prooven to be quite rich in Quantainium.
Quite large minable Asteroid patches seem to be very common in this Belt.
In the effort to increase our efficiency in mining operations and also create Hotspots for possible ORG-Frontier bases/Capitalship locations it has been suggested that it might be worth looking into the distribution of Quantainium deposits in the Aaron Halo Belt.

### Goal
So the Goal is formulated as such:
> Determine **if** there are Volumes in the Aaron Halo Belt which contain increased ammounts of valuable mineable Ores. If that might be the case the location of these **Hot Spots** will be valuable information for any future mining operations.

Immediate focus is placed on the Ore Quantainium as it is, even with price fluctuations, the most valuable resource currently mineable. **As of *3.13***


## Methodology
### "Random" Probing of the Aaron Halo Belt
Fast and agile scanner ships get sent into different regions of the Aaron Halo Belt and are tasked with finding and scanning for resources.
If those are found three distances are documented:
Distance |CRU | MIC | ARC
--- |--- | --- | ---
km |x | y | z

Please not that these distances are the ones to the planets!!
These distances allow for a rough map creation and asteroid tracking and in future it will be faulty but as of *3.13* the planets do not orbit and so they can be used for distance and vector calculations.
In future maybe the jumppoints and the Stanton Star it self can be used for relative positioning.

### Mining Operations
Mining Operations offer a huge opportunity to probe the Aaron Halo Belt as they are functionally always within it.
Here in a similar style the Positions of the Asteroids should be tracked.

## End Goal

The ultimate goal would be to show that there are probability volumes in which Quantanium is more dominant than other Ores.
This would be a breakthrough as in targetting these high probability volumes the time for searching for valuable asteroids gets cut down dramatically.
This "Operation" would also lay the ground work for future scientific ORG work, as the first workflows can be established and tested. 
As well as experienced in scientific working can be accumulated.
In the long run such an early research project could improve the ORGs chances of finding beneficial and note 
worthy hotspots in a plethora of different systems which could give Honour the edge in resource acquisition and transport.
In short an early exercise in such an activity might not give this org an advantage in the active research goal of improving 
scanning and mining times and delays and Miner queues or pauses due to a lack of asteroids, **BUT** it might lay the groundwork 
for future research projects and might be a very good testbed for different kinds of methodology.
