### MINER

#### Prospector
[Lancet MH1](https://starcitizen.tools/Lancet_MH1) Overclocked for Quantanium mining

[Helix I](https://starcitizen.tools/Helix_I) for everything else

#### Argo Mole

Starboard/Port [Lancet MH2](https://starcitizen.tools/Lancet_MH2)

Bow [Helix II](https://starcitizen.tools/Helix_II)

Main thought beeing that the Lancet MH2 are debuffing the asteroid and the main power comes from the Helix II

### RSI Orion

TBD

### SCANNER

- [600i](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/600i/600i-Explorer)
- [MSR Mercury Starrunner](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/crusader-mercury-star-runner/Mercury-Star-Runner)

TBD: future additions in terms of improved RADAR or other helpful/changing utility

### REFINERY

TBD

## Gameplay Loops

### SCANNING

1. GOTO Aaron Halo Belt as described in [Location](#location)
2. Scan for targeted [ORE](#ore). This should be discussed in VC or TC before the operation begins. Most commonly Quantanium, as of 3.13, will be targeted. 
3. Determine if the asteroid is worth taking, either by a calculator or by an estimation.

eg.: 50% Quantanium, 2000 mass is not worth taking |40% Quantanium 5000 mass is worth for one [prospector](#prospector) | Multiple ~30% 5k worth for the [Argo Mole](#argo-mole)

4. Note the appropriate distances in the [Tracking](#Tracking-the-Aaron-Halo-Belt) spreadsheet.
5. Call Mining ships, according to the actual worth of the asteroid
6. Get Payed finders reward
7. Continue from step 2

### MINING

1. GOTO Aaron Halo Belt as described in [Location](#location)
2. Scan for ore if none has been found
3. If a suitable Asteroid has been found, team up with other miners
4. Crack Asteroid fully into purple extractable pieces
5. One Miner extracts and ships the [ORE](#ore) to CRU-L1 for refinement | Other Miners continue from step 2

Miners take turns in extracting the Ore, so that after n asteroids are mined, all n members of the Miner Squad get paid.
Miners should always double check if an Asteroid is worth taking!

### REFINING
Currently the Dinyx Solventation should be used at CRU-L1.
Keep in mind that it will take approx. 1d to complete a full Prospector.
The progress is saved between servers, but not between patches!

## Getting Paid as a Miner

### Unrefined [ORE](#ore)
Unrefined [ORE](#ore) can be sold at the Refineries at the L1-Stations
There it is sold for approx. 50% of its refined value. (This is a way of gauging the potential payout of a certain ammount of [ORE](#ore))

### Refined [ORE](#ore)
The refined [ORE](#ore) has to be transported to a [LZ](#lz) and sold at the trade terminal there.
Caution, refined [ORE](#ore) cannot be transported in a Prospector



## ORE

### Tracking the Aaron Halo Belt
Please track the distance to ARC-L3 and CRU-L1 in the following google spreadsheet.

## Guidelines

### [ORE](#ore) Ammount
On normal ship scanners a range is given.
ALWAYS calculate with the left Percentage as that guarantees that there is at LEAST that value in the asteroid

### Mining Power and Instability

#### OPC (Optimum Power Cracking)
Keeping the energy level at or slightly above the optimal point.

#### Pulse Cracking
Increase power and approach the upper limit for optimal charging.
Decrease power dramatically to make it fall back down again.

### Ship spacing
Only the Ships which are actively supplying power to the Asteroid should be in close proximity to the Asteroid.
The ships which are only stabalizing the asteroid should be at the outter limit of the Laser range.

### Cargo hauling
Only take approx. one Prospector worth of Cargo to an [LZ](#lz) as there is a limit on the ammount of goods one LZ can buy at one certain time.
