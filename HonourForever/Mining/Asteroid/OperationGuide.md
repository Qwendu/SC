Quick and dirty mining OP 3.13

Scanners and Gunners as well as Prospectors can and should be recruited from in game servers or other recruitment places/opportunities.

## Scanners (Everybody who wants to earn money can do this)
Asteroid finders reward 50k

~5k Mass/ 20% -> Call Prospector

~5k Mass/ 40% or multiple high percentage ones -> Call Mole

## Prospector miners (Encouraged for those who have faith in their mining ability)
After confirmation of Asteroid Miner who takes the Asteroid to refinery pays the findersreward to the Scanner
Miners are responsible for their miningability, the transport of the goods and the refinement process

## Mole Gunners (Encouraged for Mining beginners)
Gunners get 100k per successfull mole run
Gunners are mainly used for stabalizing the asteroid
Gunners are not responsible for refinement or transport thats the pilots job

## Feedback is appreciated
